1. Industrial Shields “WiFi PLC” (Arduino-based)
A Spanish company offers PLCs with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth alongside industrial I/O and communication ports. Specs include:
	•	Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (150 Mbps), Bluetooth 4.2
	•	Ideal for remote monitoring, data logging, and IoT (supports MQTT, Modbus, etc.)
	•	Acts as AP or client; supports robust industrial use and Linux/Android OS options industrialshields.com
Great for professionals seeking open, flexible, and modern connectivity, though it's more hacker-friendly (Arduino/Linux) than conventional PLC platforms.

2. SensiNext Wi-Fi PLC Series
Another specialist offering programmable controllers with built-in Wi-Fi + GSM modules (GPRS/SMS):
	•	Wi-Fi b/g/n support
	•	TCP/UDP, client/AP/bridge/router modes
	•	Android app for remote control via phone
	•	Outdoor usage up to ~100 m (3 dBi antenna) sensinext.com
These are compact micro-PLCs aimed at remote automation, ideal where cost and direct cloud/phone access are key.

4. Retrofit Solutions: Add-on Wi-Fi Bridges
If you already have a traditional PLC and only need network access for programming or monitoring:
	•	Industrial radio bridges (e.g., Prosoft, Phoenix Contact) offer Wi-Fi-to-Ethernet reliability Reddit+1
	•	Mini travel routers/TP-Link Nano/Unifi client-end devices can be plugged into your PLC's Ethernet port to create a Wi-Fi hotspot or bridge — well-liked in industrial forums PLCtalk
This method works with almost any PLC and is especially handy for temporary setups (e.g., maintenance, commissioning).
